          <p class="case-text">
            This React Movie App lets a User Register and Sign In to see a
            Display of Movies, that are stored in a Databank. It comes in with
            Features like Adding a Movie to your Favorites or editing your
            Profile.

          <h2 class="case-titles">Goals of this Project</h2>
          <p class="case-text">
            This Project was my first Introduction to the Mern Stack, a Group of
            Technolgies thats Lets Developers create Fullstack Aplications. So
            the Porpose of this Project was to learn and showcase my Experience
            in that set of Technolgies.

          <h3 class="case-titles">Building the Backend</h3>
          <p class="case-text">
            First Step of the Project was to build the Backend of the
            Application: A Mongo DB Database interacting with Node.JS that lets
            me save, read, update and delete Data. So first I had to create a
            list of Movies, containing Information about like Director, Genre
            and a brief Description. To be on the Save side, I used an URL for
            the Images that gives me random unlicensed Images for each Movie.
            Secondly, I created the User which contains typical Information you
            normally register on Sites, like Birthday Password and Username.
            Additionally, each of them as an Empty list of Favorites Movies.
            Later the List will contain an Id of Movies the user has selected as
            his Favorites.
          </p>

          <p class="img-text">Postman Tests on the Endpoints</p>

        <div class="mid-block">
          <div class="case-text-block case-test">
            <p class="case-text">
              After that I began coding the RESTful API, which interacts with
              that Database, using Node.js and Express. With that I created the
              Endpoints I needed to let the Application interact with the
              Database in terms of Updating, reading etc. So later I can use
              HTTP Methods of these Endpoints later in the Frontend Part of the
              App. To test these Endpoints, I used Postman to check if the
              Correct data is returned and to make sure everything work as
              expected. For the Login Process, the API “hashes” the Password
              (make it readable only for the API) and returns a JWT Token. The
              Token is later used to check if the User is logged in or not.

        <div class="case-text-block">
          <p class="case-text">
            So, after being mostly done with the API before going to the next
            Step it was Important to document it. I created a HTML document
            Table which describes in Detail what each Endpoint was doing. That
            later helped me when building in the Endpoints to the Frontend Part.
            After being done it uploaded it to Heroku.

        <div class="case-text-block case-test">
          <p class="case-text">
            For building the Frontend I learned to use one of the most popular
            Frameworks: React. So, I familiarized myself with building
            Components, how to use State and Props and how to use the Component
            Life Circle Methods. I used a Mix of class and functional Components
            in this App to learn how to use both. Each Features of the App got
            its own Component, for example the Movies get displayed in a Card
            that are in turn Displayed in the Movie Component that shows the
            whole List in the Main Component. I used Axios as a way to send HTTP
            Request to my API to interact with the Data. <br />
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="case-img">
          <img src="img\case_study\4.PNG" alt="" />
          <p class="img-text">Movie Cards</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="case-text-block">
        <p class="case-text">
          To navigate the App, I used React Router which sends the User
          automatically to the Login Page if there is no Token stored (meaning
          he is not logged in) So, I got the Data from the logged in User stored
          alongside the JWT Token. How do I use the List of Favorited Movies the
          User has and display the Tittles in his Profile? Because right now the
          list only contains ids. The solution to this was to also save all the
          Movies to the Local Storage and Compare the Id of both Lists. That
          saves time from making API calls and it also enables me to check if
          the Movie is in the List inside the Card Component. That way the
          Option to either add or remove the Movie to the List of Favorites can
          change dynamically. After again being mostly done, I used Redux to
          change how State is managed in the App. Which is not exactly necessary
          for such a small App, but it enabled me to learn it for building
          bigger Applications in the Future. <br />

          This Project was projected to take about 2 Month in Total. But it took
          me some week longer to really figure out the in and outs of Basic
          React. But afterwards I got more confident in using it for later
          Projects.
