          <p class="case-text">
            This React movie app lets a user register and sign in to see a
            display of movies, that are stored in a database. It comes in with
            features like adding a movie to your favorites or editing your
            profile.

          <h2 class="case-titles">Goals of this project</h2>
          <p class="case-text">
            This project was my first introduction to the MERN-Stack, a group of
            technologies that let developers create Full-Stack applications. So
            the purpose of this project was to learn and showcase my experience
            in that set of technologies.

          <h3 class="case-titles">Building the Backend</h3>
          <p class="case-text">
            The first step of the project was to build the Backend of the
            Application: A Mongo DB Database interacting with Node.JS that lets
            me save, read, update and delete Data. So first I had to create a
            list of movies, containing information about like director, genre
            and a brief description. To be on the safe side, I used an URL for
            the images that give me random unlicensed Images for each movie.
            Secondly, I created the user which contains typical information you
            normally register on Sites, like birthday, password and username.
            Additionally, each of them as an empty list of favorites movies.
            Later the list will contain an ID of movies the user has selected as
            his favorite.
          </p>

        <div class="mid-block">
          <div class="case-text-block case-test">
            <p class="case-text">
              After that, I began coding the RESTful API, which interacts with
              that Database, using Node.js and Express. With that, I created the
              Endpoints I needed to let the Application interact with the
              Database in terms of Updating, reading, etc. So later I can use
              HTTP Methods of these Endpoints later in the Frontend part of the
              App. To test these Endpoints, I used Postman to check if the
              correct data is returned and to make sure everything works as
              expected. For the login process, the API “hashes” the Password
              (make it readable only for the API) and returns a JWT-Token. The
              token is later used to check if the User is logged in or not.

        <div class="case-text-block">
          <p class="case-text">
            So, after being mostly done with the API before going to the next
            Step it was Important to document it. I created a HTML document
            table which describes in Detail what each Endpoint was doing. That
            later helped me when building in the Endpoints to the
            Frontend-Website. After being done it uploaded it to Heroku.

      <div class="mid-block">
        <div class="case-text-block case-test">
          <p class="case-text">
            For building the Frontend I learned to use one of the most popular
            framework: React. So, I familiarized myself with building
            components, how to use State and Props, and how to use the React
            "Component Life Circle" methods. I used a mix of class and
            functional components in this app to learn how to use both. Each
            feature of the App got its own component, for example, the movies
            get displayed in a card that is in turn displayed in the movie
            component that shows the whole list in the main component. I used
            Axios as a way to send an HTTP request to my API to interact with
            the data. <br />
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="case-img">
          <img src="img\case_study\4.PNG" alt="" />
          <p class="img-text">Movie Cards</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="case-text-block">
        <p class="case-text">
          To navigate the app, I used React Router which sends the user
          automatically to the login page if there is no token stored (meaning
          he is not logged in) So, I got the data from the logged in user stored
          alongside the JWT Token. How do I use the list of favorite movies the
          user has and displays the titles in his profile? Because right now the
          list only contains ids. The solution to this was to also save all the
          movies to the Local Storage and compare the ID of both lists. That
          saves time from making API calls and it also enables me to check if
          the movie is in the list inside the card component. That way the
          option to either add or remove the movie to the list of favorites can
          change dynamically. After again being mostly done, I used Redux to
          change how State is managed in the app. Which is not exactly necessary
          for such a small app, but it enabled me to learn it for building
          bigger applications in the future. <br />

          This project was projected to take about 2 months in total. But it
          took me some weeks longer to figure out the ins and outs of basic
          React. But afterward, I got more confident in using it for later
          projects.

        During this project, I worked with my tutor who helped me figure out

        could improve my code.
